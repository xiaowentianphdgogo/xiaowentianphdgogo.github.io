About Me
======

* I'm Xiaowen Tian, second year Ph.D. student in [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ncsu.edu/) at NC State University.
* I am working as a graduate research assistant at NC State under the guidance of Prof. Robert W. Heath Jr. and Prof. Nuria Gonzalez-Prelcic.
* My research interest is in digital processing techniques in wireless communication systems. I am currently working on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces in millimeter wave systems.


## Research Projects

### Secure Beamforming in Millimeter Wave Systems

Millimeter wave channels are sparse, but Alice, Bob and Eve may share some common scatters, which makes eavesdropping easier. However, such special structure in the channel can also be exploited to null the signals transmitted through those common scatters to avoid eavesdropping.

### Pilot Spoofing Detection and Secure Transmission

When Eve sends the same pilots as Bob during uplink transmission, Alice can be spoofed to transmit confidential signals to Eve during downlink transmition. In this project, we proposed a Random Training-Assisted (RTA) algorithm, which exploits the randomness of the pilots to detect the existence of Eve. In addition, we proposed enhancement transmission strategies for both detection results of present/absent Eve.
