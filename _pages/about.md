# About Me
* I'm Nitish Vikas Deshpande, first year Ph.D. student in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) at [NC State University](http://iitk.ac.in/).
* I am working as a graduate research assistant at NC State under the guidance of Prof. Robert W. Heath Jr.
* I graduated from [Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/),  [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India](http://iitk.ac.in/) in May 2021.
* My research interest is in analysis and design of wireless communication systems. I have used tools from signal processing, information theory, estimation theory, optimization theory, and stochastic geometry. I am also interested in applying tools from electromagnetism, circuit theory, and machine learning for problems in wireless communication.
